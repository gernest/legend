# legend of microservices [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gernest/legend.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gernest/legend)

Mircoservice architechture explained with golang.


__NOTE: This is still under heavy construction, stay safe and don't try this.__

# Synopsis
This is an interactive, fictional story of microservices architecture. There has
been a lot of buzzwords around microservices, and just like you I got courious
and had to go neck deep to unveil this myth.

I will be using the go(Golang) programming language to explain what I know about
microservices. Which means this text will cover interesting parts of the
language too.

To make things a bit interesting, I will design and build a bare bones twitter
clone in a microservice way.

The accounts below are totally my own and by now you should be aware that I am
no expert in anything academic, so take it with a grain of salt. I advice you
read this just like any other boring fiction art. 

# Intended audience
This is for technical people with a background in web development. The knowledge
of go(Golang) is optional as many of the things explained here might apply to
any programming language.

# Things to be covered

* microservice
* service isolation
* service discovery
* service configuration
* service orchestration
* restful APIs
* service registry
* service scaling
